## Agenda for today:
### Feedback from EDI LPIs to report/discuss 
* their recommendations
    * The "preferred" list 
      * should be short. They would like to see a list that could be distributed as a recommendation. 
         * OK to use this list to promote ISO
         * return an info - they feel that warn is too strong, because most datasets we handle are from locales that don't use ISO
      * what we are calling a "preferred" list should be renamed "guaranteed_verifiable"
    * congruence check should try to parse anything
      * warn if fail

### November release
* Our WG should decide 
   * how/if to use Nov 13 water cooler
   * if checks can still go into production 11/15: dateTimeFormatString, dateTimeCongruence
   * they could have a longer period on staging, eg. 6 months.

## Notes
* dateTimeFormatStringPreferred
  * Behavior
    * ISO is preferred format, Colin has written the rule-based recommendation, which we will distribute 
      * coding the check is easier with a list, and some people may want to download it. 
      Hwever, we expect most people (data managers) to use the rule-based recommendation, not the list.
   * Deployment: deploy as "warn" on staging. Next wednesday. 
      * after discussion with IMC (monday) consider recoding as and "info" on production. We already know that about half the current
      datasets do not have datetime formats in the preferred list, so this would be more 'user-friendly'
        * if we go with info, we will examine mechanism to make the info more prominent in the report presentation layer. 
          * e.g., failure would result in a yellow box for ALERT! 
  
* dateTimeCongruence
  * Behavior: check already tries to parse any string. so effectively is already complying with EDI suggestion. 
  * Deployment: as warn, usual pattern, after additional testing
    * Test dataset (Colin): ___
    * estimated deployment date: ____ 
  
* Future activities:
   * EDI should help people get their datetimes into ISO formats. Possible approaches:
      * Reformat an incoming dataset, changing only the datetimes
         * in a workflow, product is a derived dataset
      * work with submitters
         * offer a tool to ingest a data table, reformat
            * should include a step to ensure the meaning of datetime values has not changed 
         * consider local culture, in which data managers feel they cannot alter data that are submitted
   * EML 2.2
      * suggest improvement to documentation
         * format string notation complies with ISO
      * suggest enhancement to EML 2.2
         * add a system attribute to dateTimeFormatString element
         * justification: assist parsers 
         * examples
         <code>
         <dateTimeFormat system="">YYYY-MM-DD</dateTimeFormat>
         </code>
