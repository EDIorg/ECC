# Next call: 2017-11-09 11:00-07
## Agenda
* feedback from LTER EDI LPIs to report/discuss 
    * "preferred" list should be short.
      * what we are calling a "preferred list" should be renamed "guaranteed_verifiable"
      * return an info (feeling is that warn is too strong, becuase most US datasets don't use ISO)
    * congruence check should try to parse anything
      * warn if fail

## November release
* We should decide 
   * how/if to use Nov 13 water cooler
   * if checks can still go into production 11/15: dateTimeFormatString, dateTimeCongruence
   * they could have a longer period on staging, eg. 6 months.
