## Overview
### Compare dataTable header row to attribute names
Some programs, (e.g. R, matlab) are able read in the first row (header row) of a data table and convert the names found there to variables in code. EML metadata also contains additional info that is not in the table header. The simplest way for metadata to be reliably attached to a column of values is via the attributeName (in metadata) and the entity header. 

This check displays the header row alongside attribute names for the user to compare their content visually. The check does not attempt to ascertain if the header and attributeNames match because table-headers may be composed of multiple lines, and if so, the matching line cannot be identified. 

Checks returning warn or errors are released twice a year. A quorum of users approved releasing "info" checks as soon as they become available because info checks do not affect report results in any way, but may be of use to data managers.
