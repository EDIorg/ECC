checks to be released 2018 May 15:

- 2 datetime checks:
  - Justification:  users often need the ability to query or filter data values by date. Before data values can be queried or filtered, dates in data entities must be parsed and interpreted.
  - dateTimePreferred 
    - Type: metadata
    - Action: reads an external list of preferred dateTime formatStrings. Compares ```//attribute/measurementType/dateTime/formatString``` to that list
    - Returns: warn, if given formatString is not in that list
  - dateTimeCongruence
    - Type: congruence
    - Action: confirms that data values adhere to the format string given in metadata. Runs only for dateTime/formatString in thw preferred list.
    - Returns: warn, if data values do not match formatString


- fundingElementPresence 
  - Type: metadata
  - Action: looks for presence of the optional EML element ```<funding>```. 
  - Returns: warn, if absent
  - Increasingly, funders (NSF) are asking for datasets to be aggregated by funding code. In EML 2.1.x this is the only location to record that information. A planned addition to EML 2.2 would have additional fields for structuring award information.
