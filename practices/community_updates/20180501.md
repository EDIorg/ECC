## checks to be released 2018 May 15:

- 2 datetime checks:
  - Justification:  users often need the ability to query or filter data values by date. Before data values can be queried or filtered, dates in data entities must be parsed and interpreted.
  - dateTimePreferred 
    - Type: metadata
    - Action: reads an external list of preferred dateTime formatStrings (generally ISO). List available at ___. Compares ```//attribute/measurementType/dateTime/formatString``` to that list
    - Returns: warn, if given formatString is not in that list
  - dateTimeCongruence
    - Type: congruence
    - Action: confirms that data values adhere to the format string given in metadata. Runs only for dateTime/formatString in thw preferred list.
    - Returns: warn, if data values do not match formatString


- fundingElementPresence 
  - Type: metadata
  - Action: looks for presence of the optional EML element ```<funding>```. 
  - Returns: warn, if absent
  - Increasingly, funders (NSF) are asking for datasets to be aggregated by funding code. In EML 2.1.x this is the only location to record that information. A planned addition to EML 2.2 would have additional fields for structuring award information.



## Overview
Date-times are complex. As labels for points in time, they have features of other types of measurements, and when correctly parsed, can be used in computations (e.g., for to compute duration). Users have requested the ability to query, filter or plot data values by date-times. Before data values can be queried or filtered, they must be parsed and interpreted. Many programming languages have libraries for date-time parsing, and may also layer on their own interpretations. The simplest solution would have been to accept the datetime interpretation of one processing language, but this was not consistent with the language-agnostic spirit of EML. 

There are two parts to EML date-time checking, and consequently, two checks, which work together.
1. The working group created a list of "preferred dateTime formats".
