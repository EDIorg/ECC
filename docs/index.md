History: Work began in 2009 at the LTER All Scientists Meeting in Estes Park, CO, and included contributions from the NCEAS Ecoinformatics programming group for DML-related issues (from Matt Jones, Mark Shildhauer, Ben Leinfleder and Jing Tao). Data-metadata checking was added to the PASTA-based repository of the LTER in 2013.
