# EML Congruence Checker working group 

## Membership
EDI: Margaret O'Brien (chair), Colin Smith, Duane Costa

LTER: Gastil Gastil-Buhl, Jason Downing, Sven Bohm

History: Work began in 2009 at the LTER All Scientists Meeting in Estes Park, CO, and included contributions from the NCEAS Ecoinformatics programming group for DML-related issues (from Matt Jones, Mark Shildhauer, Ben Leinfleder and Jing Tao). Data-metadata checking was added to the PASTA-based repository of the LTER in 2013.
